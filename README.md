## Modules and modes

Overview of each module

1. Preprocessing
2. Layout Analysis
3. Text Recognition
4. Semantic Labeling (not yet implemented)
5. Entity linking (not yet implemented)

The pipeline can be run in three different modes:
1. Prediction (work in progress)
2. Evaluation (work in progress)
3. Debugging


## Usage

### Run with docker
> **Tested on macos with M1 Chip and Docker Desktop v4.35.1**

1. [Download necessary models](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth) into [./models](./models/) directory.
<!-- only sam model downloaden? -->
<!-- TODO put one image as test image -->
2. One test image is available inside `data/images` directory. You are free to add more images into this directory. As for now only 10 images will be processed. If you would like to process more just change the `max_images` parameter inside [docker_workflow_config.yaml](./configs/docker_workflow_config.yaml)
3. Run the containers to serve prefect and workflow (prefect deployments):
    ```
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
    ```
    At first execution this will download further necessary models.
4. Wait until the `kiebids_ocr` container started (indicated by message `You can also run your flow via the Prefect UI ...`) and open the prefect UI in your browser `http://0.0.0.0:4200/`
5. On the left sidebar click on `Deployments` and select the `KIEBIDS deployment`
6. Click upper right button `Run` and select `Quick run`

Behaviour:
- This will trigger a deployment run
- You can follow the progress in your terminal for more detailed logs.
- The produced results of each respective module can be inspected inside the `data/debug` directory.

### Run ocr flow locally
1. Adapt [workflow_config.yaml](./configs/workflow_config.yaml) to your needs.
   e.g., set `image_path` to the path of your input images, etc.
2. Follow the installation instructions for your preferred method.
3. Run the workflow.
4. Inspect the results â€“ PAGE XML files by default, images when in debug mode.


## Installation

There are two ways to run this application:

1. from the command line in a local Python environment that will run the workflow automatically.
2. as dockerized application which allows you to start workflow runs from the Prefect frontend.

The dockerized variant is preferred in the long run but is not yet fully functional.
For the time being, use the local variant.

### Local Python environment

Set up a virtual environment using your preferred Python management tool.

**barebones `venv` example:** Make sure you have Python 3.10(.13) installed.
```bash
python3.10 -m venv app-kiebids
source app-kiebids/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`conda` example:**
See [conda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for further information on installing conda.
```bash
conda create -n app-kiebids python=3.10.13
conda activate app-kiebids
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`uv` example:**
(See [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for further information on installing uv.)

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -U pip
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Once you set up a virtual environment and installed the dependencies, you can run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:**

```bash
bash run_flow.sh
```

This will start the prefect server in background (if not started so far) and execute the basic flow.
For further script options, see:
```
bash run_flow.sh --help
```


**Alternatively you can start the work flow by running the `ocr_flow.py` script directly:**

```bash
prefect cloud login  # if not already logged in; will provide a link to log in
python kiebids/ocr_flow.py
```


### Dockerized application

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker compose` installed and Docker is running on your machine.
See [docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for further information.

TODO: Add instructions for installing `docker compose`.

**Start the application by running the following command in your terminal:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

**You can now access the frontend at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).**

**To stop the application:**
```bash
docker compose stop  # stops the application
docker compose down  # stops the application and removes the containers
```


## Testing

Run pytests:
```bash
pytest -s
```

## Debugging

### Observe debugging results in the FiftyOne app

Set ocr flow to debug mode inside the [workflow config file](./configs/workflow_config.yaml).
After processing a fiftyone app is served at the displayed URL. It persists previous results of each module for each given image.
You can also run the app standalone to inspect your previous runs by running
```
python kiebids/ocr_flow.py --fiftyone-only
```

You can inspect the results for each image by filtering the `image_name` field inside the app.
